Everything is working as described in the lab manual.
There were some input and output inaccuracies in the lab manual description but they work correctly in my program.
I have made a more elaborate function for increasing and decreasing the patient count for doctors since the one described in the function description is not what is executed in the example.
No memory leaks and no errors.
make and run as "lab7"
