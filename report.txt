1.Explain why it is advantageous to use priority heaps in hospital management systems.
It is advantageous to use priority heaps in hospital management systems because the important information like critical patients(at the top of max-heaps according to intensity) and doctors that are available(at the top of min-heaps according to patients assigned) can be accessed quickly and easily. Updating them is also very easy.

2.Explain a few features which should be incorporated into the hospital patient and doctor management system for the system to be useful in an actual (i.e., real-world hospital) for managing emergency room patient cases.
First both the systems should be linked and update dynamically when either the doctor or patient system is accessed. One could add a feature of k-top least occupied doctors who will be contacted in case of emergency room patient cases since they are least likely to be occupied(only if they do not have a doctor assigned or if assigned doctor is busy).

3.If we need to apply priority heaps in product recommendations (based on features or product ratings), how can we apply them?
The most intuitive way to apply priority heaps in this case is to make a max k-heap with the rating as a comparison key so that the higher rated product recommendation goes on top therefore being displayed first.
